			Travel & Explore was the brainchild of two individuals who followed their dreams, ignoring the distractions of the late 80s, to create something beautiful, something they both loved doing- a business model that revolved around adventure travel. What started as an epic road trip in the wild and desolate lands of Africa, soon emerged as a world-famous travel desk, one that offered unseen and unheard adventures to people around the world.

			Today, Travel & Explore is responsible for helping out more than 100,000 tourists around the world and its staff of 1000 work tirelessly to ensure that each of the 800-odd itineraries that the company runs presents the perfect balance between adventure, culture, history and natural beauty.

			You’re in Good Hands
			Travel & Explore organizes itineraries across Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East. They even offer trips to the Arctic and Antarctica! No wonder that Intrepid grabbed countless awards and accolades over the years- from being the 2002 Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year to winning the PATA award in the year 2007.

			We take the stress out of inter-railing, so you can go everywhere you’ve always wanted to go without worrying about the boring stuff. With transport, accommodation and directions included, we’re pioneering a new way to travel Europe.

			Pick from our popular routes or make your own. If you want the best inter-railing experience, then book one of our group tours — travel in a small group with a dedicated Euroventure group leader.
